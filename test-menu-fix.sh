echo "🔧 Testing Menu Highlighting Fix"
echo "==============================="

echo ""
echo "✅ Fix Applied:"
echo "1. Replaced nzMatchRouter with routerLinkActive"
echo "2. Added [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\" to parent routes"
echo "3. Used 'ant-menu-item-selected' class for Ant Design compatibility"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "- /dashboard → Only 'Dashboard' highlighted"
echo "- /clients → Only 'All Clients' highlighted (exact match)"
echo "- /clients/new → Only 'Create Client' highlighted"
echo "- /clients/123 → Only 'All Clients' highlighted (exact match)"
echo "- /clients/123/edit → Only 'All Clients' highlighted (exact match)"
echo "- /users → Only 'All Users' highlighted (exact match)"
echo "- /users/create → Only 'Create User' highlighted"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Technical Details:"
echo "- routerLinkActive: Applies 'ant-menu-item-selected' class when route is active"
echo "- [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\": Only matches exact route"
echo "- Without exact: true: Parent routes would be active for child routes"
echo "- With exact: true: Parent routes only active on exact match"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Start the frontend: npm run start"
echo "2. Login and test these scenarios:"
echo "   a) Navigate to /clients → Should highlight only 'All Clients'"
echo "   b) Navigate to /clients/new → Should highlight only 'Create Client'"
echo "   c) Navigate to /clients/123 → Should highlight only 'All Clients'"
echo "   d) Navigate to /clients/123/edit → Should highlight only 'All Clients'"
echo "   e) Navigate to /users → Should highlight only 'All Users'"
echo "   f) Navigate to /users/create → Should highlight only 'Create User'"
echo "3. Verify only ONE menu item is highlighted at any time"
echo "4. Verify submenus still open/close correctly"

echo ""
echo "📝 Key Changes Made:"
echo "- Removed: nzMatchRouter directive"
echo "- Added: routerLinkActive=\"ant-menu-item-selected\""
echo "- Added: [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{ exact: true }\" to parent routes"
echo "- Kept: Dynamic submenu opening logic"
echo "- Kept: All existing routing functionality"

echo ""
echo "🎨 Visual Behavior:"
echo "- Active menu items get Ant Design's selected styling"
echo "- Only one menu item can be active at a time"
echo "- Parent routes (like /clients) only active on exact match"
echo "- Child routes (like /clients/new) active when on that specific route"
echo "- Submenus still open automatically when their routes are active"
