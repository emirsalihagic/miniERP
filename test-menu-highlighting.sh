echo "🧪 Testing Active Menu Highlighting"
echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ Implementation Summary:"
echo "1. Added nzMatchRouter to all menu items"
echo "2. Added routerLink to all menu items"
echo "3. Implemented dynamic submenu opening based on current route"
echo "4. Added placeholder routes for missing modules"
echo "5. Used Ant Design's built-in active state handling"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Features Implemented:"
echo "- Dashboard: ✅ Active highlighting with nzMatchRouter"
echo "- Clients: ✅ Active highlighting + submenu auto-open"
echo "- Users: ✅ Active highlighting + submenu auto-open"
echo "- Invoices: ✅ Active highlighting + submenu auto-open (placeholder routes)"
echo "- Products: ✅ Active highlighting + submenu auto-open (placeholder routes)"
echo "- Suppliers: ✅ Active highlighting + submenu auto-open (placeholder routes)"

echo "🔧 Technical Details:"
echo "- Uses Ant Design's nzMatchRouter directive for automatic active state"
echo "- Dynamic submenu opening via [nzOpen] binding"
echo "- Route change detection via Router.events"
echo "- Proper route matching for nested routes (e.g., /clients/:id/edit)"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Start the frontend: npm run start"
echo "2. Login and navigate to different pages:"
echo "   - /dashboard → Dashboard should be highlighted"
echo "   - /clients → Clients submenu should be open, 'All Clients' highlighted"
echo "   - /clients/new → Clients submenu should be open, 'Create Client' highlighted"
echo "   - /clients/123 → Clients submenu should be open, 'All Clients' highlighted"
echo "   - /users → Users submenu should be open, 'All Users' highlighted"
echo "   - /users/create → Users submenu should be open, 'Create User' highlighted"
echo "3. Verify only one menu item is active at a time"
echo "4. Verify submenus close when navigating to other sections"

echo ""
echo "📝 Key Implementation Points:"
echo "- nzMatchRouter automatically handles active state based on routerLink"
echo "- [nzOpen] binding controls submenu visibility"
echo "- updateMenuStates() method manages submenu states on route changes"
echo "- Route matching works for all nested routes (e.g., /clients/:id/edit)"
echo "- Only one menu item can be active at a time (Ant Design behavior)"

echo ""
echo "🎨 Visual Behavior:"
echo "- Active menu items get Ant Design's default active styling"
echo "- Submenus automatically open when their child routes are active"
echo "- Smooth transitions when switching between sections"
echo "- Consistent with Ant Design's dark theme"
