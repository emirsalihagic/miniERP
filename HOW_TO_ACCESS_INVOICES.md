# 🎯 How to Access the Invoice Management System

## ⚠️ Important: You're Currently Looking at the Wrong Application!

You're currently viewing the **`/fe`** repository (old AngularJS application), but the invoice management system is implemented in the **`/miniERP`** repository (new Angular application).

## 🚀 To Access the Invoice Management System:

### 1. **Open the Correct Application**
- **URL**: http://localhost:4200
- **Repository**: `/miniERP` (not `/fe`)

### 2. **Login to the Application**
- Use your existing credentials to log in

### 3. **Find the Invoice Menu**
- Look for **"Invoices"** in the left sidebar menu
- It should be between "Dashboard" and "Products"
- The menu has a **file-text icon** 📄

### 4. **Invoice Menu Items**
- **"All Invoices"** - View all invoices
- **"Create Invoice"** - Create a new invoice

## 🔍 Visual Guide:

```
Sidebar Menu Structure:
┌─────────────────┐
│ 📊 Dashboard    │
├─────────────────┤
│ 📄 Invoices     │ ← THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
│   ├ All Invoices│
│   └ Create Invoice│
├─────────────────┤
│ 🛒 Products     │
├─────────────────┤
│ 👥 Clients      │
├─────────────────┤
│ 🏪 Suppliers    │
└─────────────────┘
```

## 🛠️ If You Don't See the Invoice Menu:

1. **Make sure you're on the correct URL**: http://localhost:4200
2. **Check the browser tab title**: Should show "miniERP" not "fe"
3. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Clear browser cache** if needed

## 📱 Application Status:

- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:4200
- ✅ **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **Invoice Routes**: Properly configured
- ✅ **Menu Integration**: Complete
- ✅ **Components**: All created and working

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Once you access http://localhost:4200, you should see:
- Professional sidebar with "Invoices" menu item
